Static comp 1 for Turing FEE Mod 1

The subject of my static comp is Cameron, the dog I'm adopting this week. I used a black and white photo of Cameron, mostly because I'm a terrible photographer. My images were all blurry, and the black and white helped minimize the blur. Because I used a black and white photo, I chose a grayscale color scheme to match, with a blue accent. I followed the pattern of the color of the squares on the comp. I chose black icons with transparent backgrounds for each square. I only used one font, but I varied the weights. 

My biggest struggle was responsiveness. First, I couldn't decide on breakpoints. Then, I couldn't decide how I wanted it to look at different sizes. I really like my mobile layout, but I wasn't sure how to improve the look of my mid-sized screens.
